How the Chat system works?

Well, it's done using Ajax Long Polling method.

When user hits Send button then the message along with timestamp, user id, username are saved to database but at the same time, these data are written to the text file in such a way that it could directly be append to the html element. This means that, I am not fetching data directly from database at the real time but data are first saved to database and then fetched so that it could be written to the text file. This way there is very less load on the server. This method is applied for all the chat system and even for displaying online users in real time.

Behind the scene:

In ajax part following steps happen..

1. First of, it sends a request to the server (without a timestamp parameter)
2. Then it waits for an answer from server.php, server_priv.php and user_online.php (which can take forever)
3. If server.php, server_priv.php and user_online.php responds (whenever), put data_from_file into #chatBox(ul html element)
4. and call the function again


In server side part following steps happen..
(This file is an infinitive loop. Seriously.)

1. It gets the file's last-changed timestamp, checks if this is larger than the timestamp of the
2. AJAX-submitted timestamp (time of last ajax request), and if so, it sends back a JSON with the data from
	file (and a timestamp). If not, it waits for one seconds and then start the next while step.
